# Understanding the workflow

## Election Cycle

### Classical Flow
1. **Add candidates**
_-- When you add your first vote, you will never can change candidate list without starting a new election --_
1. **Add votes** _Note that a same vote object can take part in multiple elections simultaneously._
1. **Get the results from one or multiple methods.** If you don't change the vote list, you can enjoy the cache engine. Else cache it's clear.

### Round trip
You can change candidates or votes at any time. The results cache will be flush _(but the results objects you_ get are still available and immutable)_ and the vote interpretation will be re-evaluated.
