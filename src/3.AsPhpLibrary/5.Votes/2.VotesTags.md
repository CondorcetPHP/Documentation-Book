# Votes Tags

You can add the same or different tag for each vote:
```php
// Directly with ```addVote``` method (will add it to the Vote object)

$election->addVote($vote, 'Charlie') ; // Please note that a single tag is always created for each vote.
$election->addVote($vote, 'Charlie,Claude') ; // You can also add multiple tags, separated by commas.

// Or into the vote object
$vote1 = new Vote ([$candidate1,$candidate2]);
$vote2 = new Vote ([$candidate1,$candidate2], 'Charlie');
$vote3 = new Vote ([$candidate1,$candidate2], ['Charlie','Hebdo']);

$election->addVote($vote1); $election->addVote($vote2); $election->addVote($vote3);
$vote1->addTags('Charlie');
```
